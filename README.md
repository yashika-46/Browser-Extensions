Browser Extension Security Guide

1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?
   Browser extensions can access and modify the web pages you visit. Malicious ones may track your browsing history, collect sensitive data, inject ads, redirect you to phishing sites, or even install malware. Risks often come from excessive permissions, outdated extensions, or ones from unverified developers.

2. What permissions should raise suspicion?
   Permissions like “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit,” access to file systems, clipboard, or downloads, and permissions to run in the background should raise concern. Broad or unnecessary permissions for a simple tool are red flags.

3. How to safely install browser extensions?
   Install only from the official browser store (e.g., Microsoft Edge Add-ons, Chrome Web Store). Check developer reputation, number of installs, recent reviews, and update history. Avoid downloading extensions from random websites or third-party sources.

4. What is extension sandboxing?
   Extension sandboxing is a security mechanism that isolates the extension’s code from the main browser process and your system. This limits the damage it can cause if compromised, preventing direct access to sensitive files or processes.

5. Can extensions steal passwords?
   Yes. If granted permission to read website content, malicious extensions can capture usernames and passwords you enter. Some may also access saved credentials in the browser if they bypass security restrictions.

6. How to update extensions securely?
   Enable automatic updates in your browser settings so extensions receive the latest security patches. Only update from the official extension store, and avoid manually installing update files from unknown sources.

7. Difference between extensions and plugins?
   Extensions are small software programs that modify or enhance browser functionality, usually installed from a store. Plugins are separate software components designed to handle specific content types (e.g., Flash, Java) and often run outside the browser’s main environment. Extensions run within the browser, while plugins integrate external capabilities.

8. How to report malicious extensions?
   Go to the extension’s page in the official browser store and click the “Report abuse” or “Report this add-on” link. Provide details of suspicious behavior and evidence (e.g., screenshots, activity logs). You can also report it to the browser vendor’s security team or your organization’s IT department.
